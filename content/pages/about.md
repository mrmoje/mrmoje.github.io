I commit my mind to Thoughts and Deeds, on Tech ideas such as these:-

In DevOps I trust, this culture - my craft, deploying to envs the systems I draft.  
I deploy to prod and mirror on dev, with vagrant plus ansible, puppet or chef.

Apps I write in digital ink. Apps I write in more slang than I speak.  
I craft them in C when in need for speed, I craft them in python for the [cloud I seed][openstack_hacking].  
I craft them in node where async takes hold, for android and tomcat - java is gold.

I test and mock them for bugs galore, with `/.+unit/`, mocha, sinon and more.  
For if I slack - in staging and prod - breaks, exploits and murphy's law!

Jack of many master of none, where I lack I strive to learn.  
I pickup fast though sometimes slow, I will not bow until I know.

So there's some tech I've worked thus far, to put food on the table and beer on the bar:)
